                            <p>
                                Many wonders of the world had struck me with awe.<br>
                                I felt proud of myself thinking I'd beheld it all,<br>
                                But you appeared and I realized how wrong I'd been<br>
                                For you possessed the kind of splendour I had never seen,<br>
                                I was speechless for there was no word worthy to describe you<br>
                                and your beauty, till now my eyes cannot get used to.<br>
                                <br>
                                You look beautiful even without it being your intention.<br>
                                And aphrodite herself would look at you with a bit of detestation<br>
                                For your radiant skin is something only Goddesses could boast about.<br>
                                That's why many hear of it and they can't help but doubt.<br>
                                <br>
                                Whenever you look me in the eye, my face turns red.<br>
                                And it's hard controlling some thoughts that run in my head<br>
                                Those that belong in the deep hours of the night<br>
                                For I felt your physique couldn't only be appreciated by sight.<br>
                                <br>
                                Your voice has a pleasing effect on the most troubled hearts<br>
                                And the melodies you produce are lovely works of art.<br>
                                Whoever calls you theirs knows the true definition of satisfaction<br>
                                For if you were mine, no one else would have my heart and attention.

                            <p>
                                I stayed in my dream for so long it felt like eternity<br>
                                It was an unpleasant journey returning to reality<br>
                                I`d blinded myself with my own feelings for you<br>
                                But when the <span>love</span> mist cleared, everything began to look <span>new</span>.<br>
                                <br>
                                I admit to creating that fantasy all my own<br>
                                I'd grown weary of spending so much time alone<br>
                                So when with beautiful strides you approached me<br>
                                My eye said a being who loves me is what they see.<br>
                                I believed those words and in it I decided to live<br>
                                Because to me the real world had nothing better to give<br>
                                I was comfortable living in this bright darkness<br>
                                For in it I felt loved, the kind that rid me of my sadness.<br>
                                So in the air I proudly built the castles we were to dwell<br>
                                Hoping they'd materialize so I'd never return to reality; this hell<br>
                                But you were the first to excuse yourself from our perfect team<br>
                                And I was left to find my way home: to wake up from my dream.<br>
                                <br>
                                The green grass we danced on barefooted in the rain<br>
                                In reality, are just burning coals I walked on feeling nothing but pain.<br>
                                For through the hurt you caused me by your departure may be unreal,<br>
                                As my feet are burned, I can brag of one emotion in or relationship being real.

                            <p>
                                I was lost and deep inside me i was broken<br>
                                When I laid down to sleep, I'd wish I wouldn't awaken<br>
                                For the pain could become so unbearable<br>
                                That my mind grew weak and I was unable<br>
                                To explain the things I really felt within,<br>
                                And I had nothing and no purpose to believe in.<br>
                                <br>
                                It's sad to say this wasn't always how it was<br>
                                I wish I knew this was what my actions would cause<br>
                                For I had drowned myself in the world's pleasures<br>
                                Striving to possess all of its treasures.<br>
                                But the more I obtained the stronger the hunger grew<br>
                                Soon my very self and dignity, away I eventually threw.<br>
                                For I thought they were all worth my happiness<br>
                                All I did was create and strengthen my own emptiness.<br>
                                And when there was nothing else in the world to claim<br>
                                My life became worthless and flooded with shame.<br>
                                <br>
                                In that miserable state, someone still loved me.<br>
                                He stood in front of me and I felt a sudden urge to plead.<br>
                                For I knew my actions had hurt him more<br>
                                Yet he said he still loves me just like he did before.<br>
                                In my darkest moments this man came as light,<br>
                                And told me these battles I'd no longer fight.<br>
                                He picked me up and gave me his peace<br>
                                And he put my broken heart together piece by piece.<br>

                                A thousand years would flutter away<br>
                                And I'd still not find the right words to say<br>
                                The things I've kept locked up deep inside<br>
                                My silent scream to have you by my side.<br>
                                <br>
                                It's hard to tell if you feel the same:<br>
                                If maybe we're both playing a similar game<br>
                                But I'm forced to doubt this very fact.<br>
                                For there should be changes in the way you act<br>
                                If your body housed such strong emotions as mine.<br>
                                But perhaps, I may not understand your every sign.<br>
                                <br>
                                When you come close so many things occur in my head.<br>
                                Upon your departure, I realize they're all words I should have said:<br>
                                You possess the face of queen and the aura of a goddess.<br>
                                A true and clear epitome of perfection and nothing else.<br>
                                A treasure sought by kings from afar<br>
                                You shine in my dark moments like a star.<br>
                                A captivating empress of such beauty<br>
                                Bowing to you is a privilege not a duty.<br>
                                <br>
                                I've looked around and there's no one else in sight<br>
                                That can calm my heart and make me feel just right.<br>

                            <h3>When An Artist Falls</h3>
                            <p>
                                There was once an artist,<br>
                                He was just a boy; a shy lad in distress<br>
                                Who at the sight of a being without flaw<br>
                                Was redeemed, but willingly trapped himself in a prison,
                                One he proudly created and called love.<br>
                                <br>
                                With elegance this being came by.<br>
                                And though words she uttered none,<br>
                                Her smile spoke the prettiest language,<br>
                                Her eyes conversed secretly with his<br>
                                And every graceful step she took<br>
                                Boast humbly of her glorious queenship<br>
                                To all who stared and stood there speechless.<br>
                                <br>
                                The artist knew a painting by the best would not justify her.<br>
                                Her beauty could not be expressed on any canvas<br>
                                For that wonderful soul of hers would lack recognition.<br>
                                And that was what he treasured most about her.<br>
                                <br>
                                So he discarded his brush and painter her with words,<br>
                                Intending to bring out more than her curves<br>
                                And hoping that at her exposure to this masterpiece<br>
                                She'd understand how this artist truly felt.<br>

                            <h3>Heartstrings</h3>
                            <p>                        
                                I played those chords on my guitar for you,<br>
                                Praying you'd look my way even once.<br>
                                I'd lost count of the notes I'd mixed up looking at you<br>
                                Yet I still created sweet melodies which attracted many,<br>
                                I just wanted you to realize that I was here for you.<br>
                                <br>
                                My piano seems to know exactly your favourite song,<br>
                                For as I sat and saw you, I knew exactly what to play.<br>
                                The key I needed came out of nowhere but it was as perfect as you.<br>
                                You smiled as you heard the song and finally look my way.<br>
                                <br>
                                When you started walking towards me I heard drum rolls,<br>
                                And as you continued smiling cymbals joined in,<br>
                                They were loud at first but became softer as you got closer.<br>
                                And when you spoke they ended with a deep sound from a bass drum.<br>
                                That sound was made by my heart, it got too excited by your voice.<br>
                                <br>
                                Music had brought us together and love had binded us.<br>
                                Now you say there's one song of mine you cherish most.<br>
                                It wasn't the one from my saxophone that always made you smile as I played<br>
                                Nor was it the notes from the valves of my trumpet that soothed you smiled as I played<br>
                                You'd fallen in love with the music you heard when your head was on my chest<br>
                                A song written specially for you and played with heartstrings.<br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You looked straight into my eyes,<br>
                                And you told me when you leave I'll never hurt again.<br>
                                I wanted to believe it was a lie<br>
                                Like everything else you kept saying to me.<br>
                                So I kept staring into those beautiful eyes of yours<br>
                                Trying to decipher what they truly kept hidden in them.<br>
                                For I desperately needed to convince my mind even a little<br>
                                That my heart made no mistake in letting you close.<br>
                                <br>
                                When finally felt your hand on my heart,<br>
                                It was hard to believe that it had to come to this.<br>
                                And when you held it and ripped it out of my chest,<br>
                                Everything you'd said and done became clear.<br>
                                And from there I was never hurt again like you said.<br>
                                For you made me exactly like you, heartless.<br>

                                Did she return my gaze? I honestly could not really tell,<br>
                                But she literally had me dazed and in love, I think I fell.<br>
                                <br>
                                Another day goes by and I watch her do same,<br>
                                I know I'm shy but I wish I knew more than her name,<br>
                                Yet at the sight of her, I'm rendered completely speechless<br>
                                For all who come near her are compelled to call her empress.<br>
                                <br>
                                Unlike her skin, there was something Idid not find fair.<br>
                                Were angels free to walk on earth, or was it just her,<br>
                                For you could tell she was a clear masterpiece from God<br>
                                And even her voice was certainly something out of this world.<br>
                                <br>
                                Silently I pray one day as she passes by, she'll realize that<br>
                                My heart always calls out her name even when my mouth is shut.<br>
